# Rust Studio

# Motivation and objective
Very often we want to implement a specific functionality but struggles to find what we need from online resources.

There are many online resources with outdated libraries and complicated examples that is difficult to start your work with.

This organisation hopes to solve such problems by providing simple-to-start template repositories and also giving some examples to aid implementation.

This organisation promotes open-source sharing and do not own any of the codes.

This organisation also do not intend to host or manage any libraries as it is meant to purely aid the coding process.

# Guidelines
Right now, as the studio is still getting ramping up, there is no proper guidelines on the management style.

The direction of management now is to contact one of the organisation owners via email to express your interest in contributing.

After which, once the agreement is made, a new repository will be created and access will be given to the contributor to add his/her codes.

A proper structure will be constructed once things stabilizes.


# Contribution Guide
Any contribution is welcome!

Please reach out to one of the organisation owners to contribute.

The contribution should be the form of a template or example, and simple instructions on how to execute the code.

The contributors are responsible to maintain the template if needed (such as upgrading dependencies) but the community are encouraged to raise any issues to aid the process.
